# SpeciesInteractionNetworks.jl

This `julia` package provides a common interface to analyze all types of data
on ecological networks. It is designed to be general, easy to expand, and work
on bipartite/unipartite as well as deterministic/quantitative/probabilistic
networks. The current version is compatible with `julia` version 1.9 and up.
