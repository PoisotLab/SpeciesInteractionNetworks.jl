# Specificity

!!! abstract

    The specificity of species in a network is measured either as a function of the proportion of resouces they effectively use (for binary networks), or as a function of the distribution of their performance on these resources (for quantitative networks). This page also lists functions related to the degree distribution.

## Measures of specificity

The packages relies on the *Paired Difference Index* to calculate specificity,
as it can be applied to both binary and quantitative data.
