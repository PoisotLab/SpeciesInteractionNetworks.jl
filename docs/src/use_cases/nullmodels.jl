# # Null models

# In order to illustrate the use of null models, we will look at the data from
# [Dupont2003Structure](@citet), and specifically generate multiple networks
# under different null models, then compare the nestedness (using [`Œ∑`](@ref))
# to the empirical network. We will then use the approach of
# [Saavedra2011Strong](@citet) to quantify the contribution of each species to
# nestedness.

# We can turn this into a network (without species names!):

edges = Binary(int_mat)
nodes = Bipartite(edges)

N = SpeciesInteractionNetwork(nodes, edges)
@info "$(richness(N,1)) pollinators"
@info "$(richness(N,2)) plants"
@info "$(length(N)) interactions"

# We first measure the nestedness of the network:

n0 = Œ∑(N)

# The next step is to generate a template probabilistic network under a specific
# null model. Here, we will focus on the null model based on the joint degree
# distribution, as used by *e.g.* [Bascompte2003nested](@citet).

Nd = nullmodel(Degree, N)

# We can draw samples from this network, and measure their nestedness. But
# because the random networks *might* have species that are disconnected. In
# order to get a sense of the importance of these networks, we will use the
# [`isdegenerate`](@ref) function to identify them:

Rd = [randomdraws(Nd) for _ in 1:5000]
connected_networks = findall(!isdegenerate, Rd)
nd = Œ∑.(Rd)
@info round.((minimum(nd), Statistics.median(nd), maximum(nd)); digits=4)

#=
!!! info "Alternative solution"

    An alternative to using `filter` and [`isdegenerate`](@ref) is to call the [`simplify`](@ref) function, which will return a network in which non-interacting species are removed. That being said, simplifying the network changes its richness. This might result in comparing apples and oranges, and seems like a more risky solution.

# This is all we need to plot the results:

f = CairoMakie.Figure(backgroundcolor = :transparent, resolution = (800, 300))

CairoMakie.hist!(ax, nd; normalization=:probability, fillto=0.0, color=(:slategray, 0.4), bins=20)

# In practice, we are often interested in deriving a *p*-value from the comparison
# of the empirical and null values of the structure measure. Note that,
# functionally, the generation of null models can be seen as permutation testing,
# and therefore we can approximate the *p*-value corresponding to the hypothesis
# that the network is *more* nested than expected under its degree distribution by
# looking at the proportion of randomized values that are larger than the
# empirical observation:

@info "ùëù ‚âà $(round(Statistics.mean(n0 .<= nd); digits=3))"

# We can then compare the result when only looking at networks without
# disconnected species:

@info "ùëù ‚âà $(round(Statistics.mean(n0 .<= nd[connected_networks]); digits=3))"

# At this time, we can think about the contribution of each species to the
# global nestedness score. To do this, we will use the approach of
# [Saavedra2011Strong](@citet), in which the contribution of each species is
# assessed by randomizing *only* the interactions of this species.

# The result will be returned as a *z*-score, where positive values indicate
# that the species contributes positively to nestedness, a value of zero
# indicates no effect, and negative values means that the species decreases
# nestedness.
