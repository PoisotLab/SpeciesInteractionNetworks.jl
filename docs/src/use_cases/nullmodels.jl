# # Null models

# In order to illustrate the use of null models, we will look at the data from
# [Dupont2003Structure](@citet), and specifically generate multiple networks under
# different null models, then compare the nestedness (using [`Œ∑`](@ref)) to the
# empirical network.

# We can turn this into a network (without species names!):

edges = Binary(int_mat)
nodes = Bipartite(edges)

N = SpeciesInteractionNetwork(nodes, edges)
@info "$(richness(N,1)) pollinators"
@info "$(richness(N,2)) plants"
@info "$(length(N)) interactions"

# We first measure the nestedness of the network:

n0 = Œ∑(N)

# The next step is to generate a template probabilistic network under a specific
# null model. Here, we will focus on the null model based on the joint degree
# distribution, as used by *e.g.* [Bascompte2003nested](@citet).

Nd = nullmodel(Degree, N)

# We can draw samples from this network, and measure their nestedness. But because
# the random networks *might* have species that are disconnected, we will remove
# them using [`isdegenerate`](@ref).

Rd = filter(!isdegenerate, [randomdraws(Nd) for _ in 1:999])
nd = Œ∑.(Rd)
@info round.((minimum(nd), Statistics.median(nd), maximum(nd)); digits=4)

#!!! info "Alternative solution"
#
#    An alternative to using `filter` and [`isdegenerate`](@ref) is to call the [`simplify`](@ref) function, which will return a network in which non-interacting species are removed. That being said, simplifying the network changes its richness. This might result in comparing apples and oranges, and seems like a more risky solution.

# This is all we need to plot the results:

f = CairoMakie.Figure(backgroundcolor = :transparent, resolution = (800, 300))
ax = CairoMakie.Axis(f[1,1], xlabel="Nestedness", ylabel="Probability")
CairoMakie.hist!(ax, nd; normalization=:probability, fillto=0.0, color=(:slategray, 0.4), bins=20)
CairoMakie.vlines!(ax, [n0], color=:black, linestyle=:dash)
CairoMakie.tightlimits!(ax)
CairoMakie.ylims!(ax, (0.0, 0.2))
CairoMakie.current_figure()

# In practice, we are often interested in deriving a *p*-value from the comparison
# of the empirical and null values of the structure measure. Note that,
# functionally, the generation of null models can be seen as permutation testing,
# and therefore we can approximate the *p*-value corresponding to the hypothesis
# that the network is *more* nested than expected under its degree distribution by
# looking at the proportion of randomized values that are larger than the
# empirical observation:

@info "ùëù ‚âà $(round(Statistics.mean(n0 .<= nd); digits=3))"
