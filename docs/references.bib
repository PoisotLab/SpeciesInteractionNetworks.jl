  abstract     = {SUMMARYNetwork theory is gaining momentum as a descriptive
                  tool in community ecology. Because organisms with the same
                  lifestyle can still exhibit ecological differences, it is
                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be
                  described. Here we show that networks of hosts (mammals) and
                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results
                  have consequences for the way we define which species to
                  include in ecological networks, which we discuss in the light
                  of community ecology and epidemiology.},

                  modification of community structure undergone by most natural
                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a
                  biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

                  coexistence of individual participants by minimizing
                  competition relative to facilitation. However, it is not known
                  whether this benefit is received by each participant node in
                  proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence.
                  This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced
                  by individual nodes in a network. We address this question by
                  applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an
                  ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here
                  we report two main results. First, nodes contribute
                  heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the
                  network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a
                  strong contributor tends to decrease overall network
                  persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor.
                  Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not
                  gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes
                  most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of
                  these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a
                  15-year time series of the interactions between designer and
                  contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As
                  with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability
                  decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases.
                  Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study
                  of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially
                  address questions about the impact of invasive species in
                  ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems.},

                  sparse matrices, are usually collected through observation
                  studies targeted at identifying species interactions. Due to
                  the extensive required sampling effort, species interaction
                  datasets usually contain many false negatives, often leading
                  to bias in derived descriptors. We show that a simple linear
                  filter can be used to detect false negatives by scoring
                  interactions based on the structure of the interaction
                  matrices. On 180 different datasets of various sizes,
                  sparsities and ecological interaction types, we found that on
                  average in about 75\% of the cases, a false negative
                  interaction got a higher score than a true negative
                  interaction. Furthermore, we show that this filter is very
                  robust, even when the interaction matrix contains a very large
                  number of false negatives. Our results demonstrate that
                  unobserved interactions can be detected in species interaction
                  datasets, even without resorting to information about the
                  species involved.},

                  among diverse assemblages of species. Early mechanism-based
                  theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and
                  several properties that are independent of species richness.
                  This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found
                  food webs to be much more complex, but these studies did not
                  provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity. Here we
                  show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void

                  most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary

                  at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and
                  variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain
                  length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and
                  trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters,
                  species number and connectance, our 'niche model' extends the

  abstract     = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of
                  ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic
                  levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels
                  (vertical diversity, including food chain length and
                  omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress
                  toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and
                  resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of
                  either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity
                  often increases resistance to predation, due to increased
                  probability of including inedible species and reduced
                  efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse
                  prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to
                  affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect
                  depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour.
                  Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a
                  trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at
                  adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer
                  variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the
                  monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This
                  complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary
                  generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and
                  resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to
                  migration. Although complementarity and selection effects
                  occur in both animals and plants, few studies have
                  conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity
                  effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of
                  complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and
                  experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {The main theories of biodiversity either neglect species
                  interactions or assume that species interact randomly with
                  each other. However, recent empirical work has revealed that
                  ecological networks are highly structured, and the lack of a
                  theory that takes into account the structure of interactions
                  precludes further assessment of the implications of such
                  network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination
                  of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the
                  influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting
                  species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks
                  between plants and their animal pollinators or seed
                  dispersers. These networks have been found to be highly
                  nested, with the more specialist species interacting only with
                  proper subsets of the species that interact with the more
                  generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective
                  interspecific competition and enhances the number of
                  coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network
                  will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter
                  the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested
                  networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts,
                  suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of
                  fields.},

  abstract     = {Summary1. Ecological specialization is a unifying concept in
                  the biological sciences. While there are reliable ways to
                  characterize specificity at individual and community levels,
                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of
                  the former.4. Based on these different evaluations for
                  species‐level (or population‐level) specificity, we recommend
                  the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are
                  available and Paired Difference Index otherwise. These results
                  will assist both applied and fundamental researchers in the
                  characterization and interpretation of species specificity.},

                  their dominance, it is no wonder that many recent studies have

  abstract     = {Summary There is a growing realization among community
                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the complexity of ecological networks has remained
                  elusive. Primarily, complexity has been defined on the basis
                  of the structural (or behavioural) complexity of the system.
                  These definitions ignore the notion of “physical complexity,”
                  which can measure the amount of information contained in an
                  ecological network, and how difficult it would be to compress.
                  We present relative rank deficiency and SVD entropy as
                  measures of “external” and “internal” complexity,
                  respectively. Using bipartite ecological networks, we find
                  that they all show a very high, almost maximal, physical
                  complexity. Pollination networks, in particular, are more
                  complex when compared to other types of interactions. In
                  addition, we find that SVD entropy relates to other structural
                  measures of complexity (nestedness, connectance, and spectral
                  radius), but does not inform about the resilience of a network
                  when using simulated extinction cascades, which has previously
                  been reported for structural measures of complexity. We argue
                  that SVD entropy provides a fundamentally more “correct”
                  measure of network complexity and should be added to the
                  toolkit of descriptors of ecological networks moving forward.},
